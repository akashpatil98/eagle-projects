# eagle-projects
 This repository contains all of my Eagle CAD PCB design projects.
# Pico
The Gerber files and BoM for Pico can be found [here](https://github.com/akashpatil98/eagle-projects/tree/main/Pico).
Pico is based on Atmel ATSAMD21 microcontroller. It can be programmed using Adruino IDE or Adafruit's CircuitPython.
It has an ARM Cortex M0+ core with a maximum clock speed of 48 MHz.

# Raven BLE
Raven BLE board is based on Nordic Semiconductor's nRF52840 SoC and supports BLE 5.0. It has an ARM Cortex M4F core and supports upto 64 MHz clock speed.
The gerber files for Ravel BLE can be found [here](https://github.com/akashpatil98/eagle-projects/tree/main/Raven_BLE).

# Software
The PCBs listed here are designed using AutoDesk EAGLE software (version 9.5.2).
